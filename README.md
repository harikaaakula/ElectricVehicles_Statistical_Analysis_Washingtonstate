## Project Overview:

Electric vehicles have been revolutionising the world, and as part of sustainability, individuals are shifting towards EV adoption. On the other hand, technological advancements, such as self-driving capabilities, are further reshaping the EV landscape. With this, it becomes essential that we analyse the patterns and trends for future developments and adoption of EVs. This led to the beginning of the analysis, where I utilised a sourced dataset of registered EVs through the Washington State Department of Licensing. 

The main objective of the analysis involves:
1. To examine the relationship between Electric Vehicle type, Battery Range, CAFV Eligibility, Make(Brand of the EV), Model
2. To understand the Market trend and identify any top brands

## Dataset Information:
The dataset has been obtained from the official Washington State open data portal: https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2/about_data

The dataset consists of information on Battery Electric Vehicles(BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles(PHEV) that are currently registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing(DOL). The dataset initially consisted of 232k observations with 17 columns; each row has information on the registered EV. 

Out of 17 variables, I have considered 6 key variables for my analysis. Below are the key variables that have been considered in the study.
