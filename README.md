# ElectricVehicles_Statistical_Analysis_Washingtonstate
**Project Overview:**

Electric vehicles have been revolutionising the world, and as part of sustainability, individuals are shifting towards EV adoption. On the other hand, technological advancements, such as self-driving capabilities, are further reshaping the EV landscape. With this, it becomes essential that we analyse the patterns and trends for future developments and adoption of EVs. This led to the beginning of the analysis, where I utilised a sourced dataset of registered EVs in Washington state. 

The main objective of the analysis involves:
1. To examine the relationship between Electric Vehicle type, Battery Range, CAFV Eligibility, Make(Brand of the EV), Model
2. To understand the Market trend and identify any top brands
